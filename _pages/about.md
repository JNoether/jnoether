I am a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence M.Sc. student at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html) interested in secure and safe machine learning. I am currently employed as an research assistant in the [Machine Teaching Group](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/) at [Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems](https://www.mpi-sws.org/), where I study red-teaming and attacks of foundation models and LLMs.
